### Guess I don't need to say more?

Welcome to the blogs

Make sure when adding images that the path name does not have spaces so if the filename has spaces you need to add %20 in the path name e.g.  
```
'/src/assets/images/file name.png'
```
Would be;
```
'![file name alt txt](../../assets/images/file%20name.png)'
```

Easiest to rename files to all lowercase and replace spaces with dashes or underscores.
